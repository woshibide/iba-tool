First feedback: 

[x] The option ’number of columns’ always on lowest number, and lets hide that option. Because it makes it hard to work with for now. 
[x] Interpolation steps standard on 10
[x] Animation speed initial at 150
[x] Could you make interpolation steps the 2nd leaver
[x] Lets hide the stroke option for now 
[x] Let’s cut the whole ‘obstacle’ option out.. its not working like we imagined it, so lets hide it for now. 

Colors:
[x] could you make only the colors in the attachment available? 
[] Or that we have all the colors as an extra pull down, but the IBA brand colors as clickable option? 
[x] And then opening the tool Standard red object on white, 
[x] and then optional for front color, background color 
[x] and the stroke we can leave out for now… 

Style: 
[x] the block with controls is now dark grey/black. Could you make that really light grey? 
[x] And could you add the IBA logo on top of the controls? 
[x] And maybe somewhere at the bottom 'Somehow for IBA’, 
[x] and if you want to put your name in the source code or somehting, go ahead!
